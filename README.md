# Sbon-rs

This project allows you to interface with the file formats used by the game Starbound. This is not yet stable with many bugs and outright errors, but it is public so that the parts which are stable can be used.

## Status

Sbon-rs is very much in development and should not be used in any non-testing scenario. Breaking changes should be expected and bugs, not_yet_implemented!, and/or todo! are still present.

## Credits
